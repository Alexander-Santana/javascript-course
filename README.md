this is a javascript tutorial by a YouTuber named SuperSimpleDev. Its a lot of projects that will help me learn the main skills ill need to create websites. 
I chose this youtube based course because I have already completed the HTML/CSS course and learned significantly from it. 
Im trying to dedicate a bit of time everyday to learning this javascript, it seems to be much more complicated then HTML/CSS
